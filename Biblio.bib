  abstractNote = {BACKGROUND: Studies are conflicting as to whether single-set resistance training (RT) are as effective as multi-set protocols with respect to promoting muscular adaptations. Several meta-analyses have shown that a clear dose-response relationship exists between RT volume and muscular adaptations. However,  a majority of studies were not specific to older individuals,  particularly women. OBJECTIVE: To determine changes in strength and body composition in elderly women following 1 vs. 3 sets of RT. METHODS: Thirty older women participated in a 12-week supervised total body RT program. Participants were randomly assigned to perform either 1 set (G1S) or 3 sets (G3S) per session. All other RT variables were held constant. Body composition was assessed by dual X-ray absorptiometry,  muscle strength was evaluated by 1RM in chest press and knee extension. RESULTS: Increases in strength were significantly (p< 0.05) greater in G3S versus G1S in both the chest press (+26.6%,  versus +20.3%) and the knee extension (+23.9% versus +16.2%). No significant (p> 0.05) differences were noted in body composition components between groups. CONCLUSIONS: Findings indicate that multiple set protocols are required to optimize strength gains in older women. Changes in body composition appear to be similar irrespective of training volume during the initial stages of RT.},
